    <h2> This page is all about who Enoch Maonga is </h2>
    <p> I am a male aged 40 years, a fine art graduate from Kenyatta University.
      I have worked in two rganizations in my sixteen year career. I started off
      as a inventory specialist at Color Creations limited without any previous experience.
      This is what landed me a job at Safaricom as a stock controller.
      With my education back ground in graphic artsa, i decided to know more how
      websites are designed and that is why I chose to take a class in programming.!</p>
