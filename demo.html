    <p>
    I have worked in two Organizations in my sixteen years career. I started
    off as an inventory specialist at Color Creations limited without any
    previous experience. With this experience moved to Safaricom as a stock
    controller. With my education back ground in graphic arts, i wanted to know
    more in designing of websites and that is why I chose to take a class in
    programming.</p>
  </div>
    <p>
   <p>I have interracted with most creative and design techniques, Mostly with
     pencil work, print, painting, ceramics and system based tools like;
     Illustrator,photoshop, Adobe indesign and currently working on Software
     development. </p>
      <p> I am looking forward to become one of the greatest software developers
        around.</p>
